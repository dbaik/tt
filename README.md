## Installation

To use WordPlate, you need to have PHP 5.6.4+ installed on your machine. You'll also optionally need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed if you want to use [Elixir](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/elixir) to compile your CSS and Javascript.

Make sure your server meets the following requirements:
- PHP >= 5.6.4
- Mbstring PHP Extension

Install WordPlate by issuing the Composer `create-project` command in your terminal:

```bash
composer create-project wordplate/wordplate
```

#### Homestead

Since we're big fans of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework we recommend you to look at [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead) to setup a local development environment. Homestead is a pre-packaged [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, HHVM, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine.

Of course, WordPlate will work with any other development environment you prefer.

## Configuration

The first thing you should do after installing WordPlate is to add [WordPress salts](https://wordplate.github.io/salt/) to your `.env` environment file.

Typically, these strings should be [64 characters long](https://wordplate.github.io/salt/). The strings can be set in the `.env` environment file. If you have not renamed the `.env.example` file to `.env`, you may do that now. If the [WordPress salts](https://wordplate.github.io/salt/) is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!

Please visit [WordPlate's salt page](https://wordplate.github.io/salt/) and copy the WordPress salts to your environment file.

#### WordPress

WordPlate supports WordPress `4.0+` and comes with the latest version out of the box. If you want to specify an older version of WordPress you may add it to your `composer.json` file.

```json
"require": {
  "johnpbloch/wordpress": "4.5.1"
}
```

This way you can lock the WordPress version number to the one you're working with. This could come in handy if you're opening your project six months from now and WordPress has released a new version with breaking changes.

## Theming

Building your theme with WordPlate works like any other WordPress environment. Please use the [WordPress documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) for reference.

#### Plate

[Plate](https://github.com/wordplate/plate) is a plugin with a bunch of defaults to help you make the most out of WordPress. It comes with handy features such as customizing the administrator dashboard. It is required by default. Please see [the documentation](https://github.com/wordplate/plate#readme) for more information.

## Plugins

[WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/) comes straight out of the box with WordPlate. It mirrors the WordPress [plugin](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/) and [theme](https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/) directories as a Composer repository.

#### How do I use it?

Require the desired plugin or theme using `wpackagist-plugin` or `wpackagist-theme` as the vendor name.

```bash
composer require wpackagist-plugin/wp-migrate-db
```

Packages are installed to `public/plugins` or `public/themes`.

#### Example
This is an example of how your `composer.json` file might look like.

```json
"require": {
    "wordplate/framework": "^4.0",
    "wpackagist-plugin/polylang": "^1.0",
},
```

Please visit [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/) website for more information and examples.

## Gulp

WordPlate has integrated [Elixir](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/elixir). It provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Gulp tasks for your WordPlate application.

#### Installation

Before triggering Elixir, you must first ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on your machine.

```sh
node -v
```

If you don't have Node on your machine you can install it by visiting their [download page](https://nodejs.org/download/).

Within a fresh installation of WordPlate, you'll find a `package.json` file in the root. Think of this like your `composer.json` file, except it defines Node dependencies instead of PHP. You may install the dependencies it references by running:

```sh
npm install
```

If you are developing on a Windows system or you are running your VM on a Windows host system, you may need to run the `npm install` command with the `--no-bin-links` switch enabled:

```sh
npm install --no-bin-links
```

#### Usage

To use Elixir and Gulp, please run one of the following commands:

##### Development

This script is for development. This script will first run all the Gulp tasks and then keep listening for changes you make in your asset files.

```sh
npm run dev
```

This script will automagically start a [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) proxy. For more information about getting started with BrowserSync, please visit the [Elixir documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/elixir#browser-sync).

##### Production

Then there is a script you should run before publishing your application. This script will compile all your asset files and revision them for [cache busting](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/elixir#versioning-and-cache-busting).

```sh
npm run prod
```

For more information about Elixir please visit the [official document page](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/elixir).

## Mail

To send email with WordPress you can use the [`wp_mail`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_mail/) helper method. WordPlate provides a simple way to add custom SMTP credentials.

Require the [mail package](https://github.com/wordplate/mail) in the root directory of your project.

```sh
composer require wordplate/mail
```

Then update the credentials in your `.env` environment file with your SMTP keys and you're good to go. Please visit the [WordPress codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/phpmailer_init) to read more about the `phpmailer_init` action hook.

## Multisite

To add multisite support to WordPlate you can [head over to our multisite plugin](https://github.com/wordplate/multisite) here on GitHub.

> **Note:** This plugin is still under development, you may use it at your own risk. We haven't had any issues ourselves but please be cautious.

## Post Types

For [custom post types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Types) we recommend looking at [Extended CPTs](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts) by [John Blackbourn](https://github.com/johnbillion). The package provides extended functionality to WordPress custom post types, allowing developers to quickly build post types without having to write the same code again and again.

```php
register_extended_post_type('event');
```

## Taxonomies

For [taxonomies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies) we recommend looking at [Extended Taxonomies
](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-taxos) by [John Blackbourn](https://github.com/johnbillion). The package provides extended functionality to WordPress custom taxonomies, allowing developers to quickly build custom taxonomies without having to write the same code again and again.

```php
register_extended_taxonomy('location', 'event');
```

## Custom Fields

For [custom fields](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields) recommend looking at the following plugins:
- [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) - Powerful fields for WordPress developers.
- [Papi](https://wp-papi.github.io/) - A different approach on how to work with fields and page types in WordPress.

## Translations

WordPlate by default, doesn't provide translations. However, we're big fans of the [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin. We've created a bridge which makes it easy to integrate Polylang within your application.

Require the translator package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

```bash
composer require wordplate/translator
```

Login to the WordPress administrator dashboard and active the [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin.

Register the translations with the `register_translations` method.

```php
register_translations([
    'general' => [
        'general-language-english' => 'The english language',
        'general-language-swedish' => 'The swedish language',
    ],
    'contact' => [
        'contact-email' => 'Contact page email string',
        'contact-mobile' => 'Contact page mobile string',
        'contact-telephone' => 'Contact page telephone string',
    ],
]);
```

Then to fetch and print a translation you can use the `trans` method.

```php
echo trans('contact-email');
```

Please visit [Polylang's documentation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) to find out more about translating your post types.

## Helpers

WordPlate includes a variety of "helper" PHP functions. You are free to use them in your own applications if you find them convenient.

WordPlate support both Laravel's [collections](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/collections) and [helper methods](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/helpers#available-methods). This means you can use great debugging methods such as [`dd()`](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/helpers#method-dd) and string helpers like [`str_contains()`](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/helpers#method-str-contains).

## Security

Though WordPlate makes your WordPress site more secure out of the box you should always try to get ahead. We suggest [reading this article](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/keeping-wordpress-secure-the-ultimate-guide/) to learn more about [WordPress security](http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress).

WordPlate comes with the [`wp-password-bcrypt`](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt) package to replace WordPress's outdated and insecure [MD5-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) password hashing with the modern and secure [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt).

We recommend taking a look at the [Soil plugin](https://roots.io/plugins/soil/) by [Roots](https://roots.io). It is a A WordPress plugin which contains a collection of modules to apply theme-agnostic front-end modifications. The plugin also address some security concerns for WordPress themes.
